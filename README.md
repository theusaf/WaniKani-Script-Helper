# wkhf â€” WaniKani Hotwired Framework

A framework for writing scripts for WaniKani, focused on WaniKani's Hotwired UI.

## What does this do?

This script works by wrapping various methods so that they can be stopped or overridden.

## Usage

Since WaniKani is becoming a single-page application, I recommend the following:

```js
// @match        https://www.wanikani.com/*
```

## API
